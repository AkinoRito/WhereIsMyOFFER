## 501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:
 Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

  

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
```

return `[2]`.

**Note:** If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).



###  My Solution

```C++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    int tempNum = -65535, tempCnt = 0, maxCnt = 0;
    vector<int> ans;
    
    void inOrder(TreeNode* t)
    {
        if(t->left)
            inOrder(t->left);
        
        if(t->val == tempNum)
            tempCnt++;
        else
        {
            tempCnt = 1;
            tempNum = t->val;
        }
        if(tempCnt > maxCnt)
        {
            ans.clear();
            ans.push_back(tempNum);
            maxCnt = tempCnt;
        }
        else if(tempCnt == maxCnt)
            ans.push_back(tempNum);
        
        if(t->right)
            inOrder(t->right);
    }
    
    vector<int> findMode(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root)
        {
            tempNum = root->val;
            tempCnt = 0;
            maxCnt = 0;
            inOrder(root);
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
```

思路：二叉平衡树按照中序遍历时是递增的，然后依次计算各个数的出现字数即可。
