In a given integer array `nums`, there is always exactly one largest element.

  

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array.

  

If it is, return the **index** of the largest element, otherwise return -1.

  

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3, 6, 1, 0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer, and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.  The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 isn't at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
```

  

**Note:**

1. `nums` will have a length in the range `[1, 50]`.
2. Every `nums[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 99]`.



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int dominantIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxN=INT32_MIN, secN=INT32_MIN, maxIdx=-1;
        for (int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++)
        {
            if (nums[i]>maxN)
            {
                secN = maxN;
                maxN = nums[i];
                maxIdx = i;
            }
            else if (nums[i]>secN)
            {
                secN = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return maxN >= 2*secN? maxIdx: -1;
    }
};

```

**NOTE**

我竟然因为给 i 初始化的时候忘记将 i 赋值为0导致WA。。。我到底有多久没用过C++了【崩溃脸
