## 566. Reshape the Matrix

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data. 

 You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two **positive** integers **r** and **c** representing the **row** number and **column** number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same **row-traversing** order as they were. 

 If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix. 

  

**Example 1:**
 

```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 1, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2,3,4]]
Explanation:
The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.
```

 

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
nums = 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
r = 2, c = 4
Output: 
[[1,2],
 [3,4]]
Explanation:
There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.
```

   

**Note:**

1. The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
2. The given r and c are all positive.



### My Solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> matrixReshape(vector<vector<int>>& nums, int r, int c) {
        // 思路：各个元素逐一拷贝
        int size1=nums.size(), size2=nums[0].size();
        if (size1 * size2 != r * c)
            return nums;
        
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        for(int i=0; i<r; i++)
        {
            vector<int> temp(c);
            ans.push_back(temp);
        }
        
        for(int i=0; i<size1*size2; i++)
        {
            ans[i/c][i%c] = nums[i/size2][i%size2];
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

见到了初始化二维vector的更加优雅的方法：

```C++
vector<vector<int>> ans(r, vector<int>(c, 0));
```

如果把初始化二维vector改成那个优雅的方法，那么运行时间和占用内存得到优化：

> Runtime: 36 ms, faster than 98.63% of C++ online submissions for Reshape the Matrix.
>
> Memory Usage: 11.5 MB, less than 100.00% of C++ online submissions for Reshape the Matrix.
